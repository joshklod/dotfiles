These are my personal preferences, but some of this stuff might be useful to
you.  Feel free to use whatever you want.

I'm using [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
for various plugins, so you'll need to `git submodule update --init` after
cloning if you want to enable them.
